# DesktopBricks
One of my first projects: an attempt to make bricks appear on top of the UI in Windows. The code is over 10 years old, and was designed for an older version of windows. (Sort of works on Windows 10)

When the program is working correctly it will spawn a bunch of little bricks on the desktop you can play with virtually by dragging them and connecting them. Also it will save the layout of the bricks into a gamestate so if you run it again your setup will be reloaded. 

Known Windows 10 Issues: 
1) The sound code does not seem to work in windows 10.
2) The mouse code seems to have an offset that makes your click register in the wrong place.
3) The game does not create a large enough virtual window for a large 4k monitor. (Moniters were a lot smaller when this code was written.)

This is intended to give a bit of a sense of how I coded back in the day. If you would like to update the code to work better for Windows 10 and update the projects to work in the current visual studio, just let me know!
